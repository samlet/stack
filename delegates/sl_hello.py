# Hello, world!

This is an example [`streamlit`](https://streamlit.io/) app running on [Glitch](https://glitch.com/).

This Glitch app install streamlit, and does a `streamlit run app.py` on port 3000 to start the app. You can edit `app.py` (where this code lies) to test this out!

## How to use this Glitch app

You can remix the Glitch project and you'll have your own project running streamlit.  

"""

"""

## Limitations

There are some limitations to Glitch, [for example](https://glitch.com/help/restrictions/):

>Projects sleep after 5 minutes if they are not used

> Projects have a limit of 200MB of disk space in the container

(and installing `streamlit` already takes up ~180MB, it seems like)

> Projects have a limit of 512MB of RAM.

> Projects are limited to 4000 requests per hour 


A few other points to consider:

- There's no GPU access, so you probably can't do a ton of crazy ML/AI stuff.

- Glitch autosaves your work while you are typing - which means, when you're editing your streamlit app, it will continuously restart over and over again while you're coding - which is a little annoying... You can turn off auto-run to avoid this

- Glitch uses Python 3.5 (as of now), so some Altair charts [may not render correctly](https://github.com/altair-viz/altair/issues/972) (which is what `st.line_chart` and `st.bar_chart` uses under the hood)

But hey, it's free, you can use this to do quick tests, and it requires no setup!
